# Augmented-Reality
Imagine buying a painting for the living room. But how would it look like? Would it match the vibe? Find that out with augmented reality! This project uses the computer vision library OPENCV to warp a digital image on an ArUco marker to generate a preview of the photo frame.

The Results folder contains a leaning tower of Pisa projected on the marker (refer Room with ArUco Markers folder) captured at various angles.
